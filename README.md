# Tuffy Bot
This is a Discord bot that I built to moderate a Discord server for my university. I named it after the school
mascot--Tuffy. The Tuffy Bot can do a bunch of neat things to maintain a Discord server. 

## Features
Below are a list of features built into the bot
* It can rate-limit users that are sending too many messages within a set timeframe
* Server members can use certain commands that begin with "!!" to have the bot say something
For example, if a user uses the command "!!ping" the bot will respond with "pong!"
* The bot can add and remove user roles for server members that are being rate limited

## Built with
This bot was built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and the Discord.js module
